## Framework of LapCSNet

## Requirements

* Windows10
* Matlab R2015b
* MatconvNet 1.0-beta23 (https://www.vlfeat.org/matconvnet/)
* CUDA 8.0

## How to Run

### Training

* Copying the function in `+dagnn` folder to your `Matconvnet` location `<MatconvNet>\matlab\+dagnn`
* Preparing the training data. (T91 and BSDS200 are included in our repo)
* Train the LapCSNet, run the code `train_LapCSN(0.1, 2, 0);`

```
The first param is CS subrate
The second param is the number of conv layers in each pyramid level
The third param is gpu setting. (0 is CPU, 1 is GPU)
```

### Testing

* Preparing the testing data. (Set5 and Set14 are included in our repo)
* Test the LapCSNet, run the code `test_LapCSN_main(100, 200)`

```
The first param is start epoch for testing model
The second param is end epoch for testing model 
```

## Additional instructions

* For training data, you can choose any dataset by yourself.
* When subrate<=0.25, the laplacian structure can be used.
